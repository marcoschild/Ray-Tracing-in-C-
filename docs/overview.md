# RayTracer Overview

This project is a simple educational ray tracer built from scratch in C.

It demonstrates:
- Vector math and ray construction
- Outputting RGB values to PPM format
- The foundation for shading, lighting, and object intersection

Use it to learn or build upon for your own experiments.
